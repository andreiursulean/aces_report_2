In this work we have seen the current status and the future directions of high accuracy positioning. We explored the Galileo E6 signal which will transmit error corrections for PPP algorithms and we have looked at state of the art GNSS receivers. The positioning accuracy has significantly improved and Galileo E6B is expected to provide a 20-centimeter positioning accuracy. This is suitable for most of the applications, however some professional users may require even better precision for which they will have to acquire corrections from a professional provider.
Regarding GNSS receivers, they have miniaturized and are present in many embedded devices and the majority of smartphones. We can see that most of the architectures use FPGAs for signal conditioning and DSP for signal processing and navigation solution computation. Also, DSP frequencies are quite high, in the range of GHz. Software GNSS receivers are becoming increasingly popular due to the accessibility of high performance, low power CPU and the need for flexibility and upgradeability of new GNSS receivers.
